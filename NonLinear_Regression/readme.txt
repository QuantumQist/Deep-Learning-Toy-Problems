Main notebook:
> Non_Linear_Regression.ipynb
It's the only thing you need to open to check the results.

Other files contain helper modules:
> `nonlinear_model_classes.py` - defines the classes with used neural networks
> `data_setup.py` - defines the functions helping to load the data into a PyTorch model
> `training_functions.py` - functions used in training of the models
> `utils.py` - utility functions

The `models` folder contains information about the pre-trained models.
